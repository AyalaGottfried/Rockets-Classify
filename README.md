# Rockets-Classify
Rafael Project- Classifying rockets to different types using data science algorithms.

In this project we received data base with data on rockets, speed, direction, location at any point in time, etc.

We now needed to classify the rockets so that we could know what type of rocket it was.

Using machine learning technique and the data base we classified the rockets.

Here for example we worked on 2 types of rockets and with the help of different types of data parameters we got graphs that express the differences between them:

Note, for example, that in Figure 4 the differences are much less noticeable than in Figure 3.

So we worked on the parameters with the most noticeable differences and reached a success of between 93% for rockets with minimal differences between them and 100% success for rockets with more noticeable differences.
